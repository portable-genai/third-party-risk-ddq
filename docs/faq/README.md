# FAQ index

Answers to the questions different teams ask when evaluating, adopting or reviewing this
repository as a common base for vendor due-diligence engines. Each file is written for a specific
audience; skim the one that matches your role.

| FAQ | For | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| [security-faq.md](security-faq.md) | AppSec / security review | server-side identity, the exposure guard, tenant isolation, secrets, supply chain, the audit chain, what is in and out of scope |
| [portability-faq.md](portability-faq.md) | Architecture / cloud / exit planning | no-lock-in, the three profiles, the sovereign exit, data export |
| [features-faq.md](features-faq.md) | Product / risk / delivery | what the engine does, what is deterministic vs model-written, and the boundary with sibling catalog systems |
| [adoption-faq.md](adoption-faq.md) | Engineering leads forking the repo | rename, upstream fixes, extension points, what stays open |
| [compliance-faq.md](compliance-faq.md) | Compliance / model risk / second line | regulatory posture, maker-checker, residency, retention, model-risk evidence |

These FAQs deliberately do **not** re-document capabilities owned by sibling systems in the GRC
catalog. Where a concern belongs to another repo (the regulatory KB Rsk1, the contract-obligation
register Rgc12, the downstream register consumer Rgc9, the guardrail gateway Hrz1, the knowledge
base Hrz2, the agent registry Hrz3, the eval platform Hrz4, observability and WORM audit Hrz5,
the human-review console Hrz7), the FAQ points at it and explains the boundary rather than
duplicating it. See [features-faq.md](features-faq.md) for the full "what this repo owns vs what
it integrates" map.

Authority order for anything these pages disagree with: [`SPEC.md`](../../SPEC.md), then
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), then [`COMPLIANCE.md`](../../COMPLIANCE.md), then
[`README.md`](../../README.md). These pages restate; they do not decide.
