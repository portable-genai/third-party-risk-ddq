"""Regenerate the derived half of ``docs/evals.md`` from the rubrics, golden sets and floors.

A page that lists metrics and thresholds by hand goes stale the first time a bar moves, and
nothing notices. This repository had exactly that: the bars lived in a Python dict AND in the
rubric files, and the two could disagree without anything failing. This repository had no
rubric directory at all until now; this makes the prose derived too.

    make evals-doc          # rewrite the generated sections
    make evals-doc-check    # non-zero when the page and the artifacts disagree (runs in check)

Only the sections named in :data:`BLOCKS` are generated. Everything else on the page is
hand-written prose addressed to a reviewer, and this script does not touch it: the point is a
document a person wrote, whose FACTS cannot drift from the artifacts they describe.
