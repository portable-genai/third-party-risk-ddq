"""Vertical-neutral domain kernel: pure-stdlib types the service reasons over.

Taxonomies are ``StrEnum``s from the commons (a member IS its wire value), citations carry
provenance, and the WORM audit record is stored already-redacted. Nothing here imports a web
framework or a cloud SDK (the commons packages it uses are themselves stdlib).

"Already redacted" is ENFORCED here rather than asked of every call site: see
:class:`AuditEvent`. The pattern selection comes from the sibling ``domain.pii``, which is the
one vertical-specific thing this module knows, because a boundary that cannot name the rows it
masks with is not a boundary. ``domain.pii`` imports only ``pii_kit``, so there is no cycle,
and ``pii_kit`` is on the core-purity allowlist.

    ``redacted_summary`` and passed their citations through untouched, so the identifier the

    so a caller that already redacted loses nothing by the second pass, and a surface added later
    cannot leak by forgetting.

    attribution, not content, and masking it would erase the only column that says who acted.
