"""Shared conversion from an escalated result to an ``review-kit`` Review payload.

Lives in the adapter layer, not the pure domain, because it depends on the kit. The subject,
summary and every citation snippet are redacted BEFORE they leave the process (the same
redact-before-anything rule the audit write obeys), using the shared ``pii-kit``, so no raw
identifier reaches Hrz7 over the wire; Hrz7 redacts again before its own audit write (defence in
depth). ``maker`` and ``tenant`` are asserted here and trusted by Hrz7 because the caller is an
authenticated S2S service; per-hop on-behalf-of token exchange is the deferred next layer.

    The subject is redacted ONCE and reused for the case reference and the idempotency key, so no
    raw identifier reaches the wire through a derived field. Masking it in ``subject``
    and passing it raw into ``case_ref`` and ``source_key`` beside it puts the identifier on the
    shared console in the two fields whose structural names make them look like keys rather than
    content. The subject is a case subject on the triage path and a vendor name on the assessment
    path, both client text; neither should carry personal data, and the redaction has to hold
    whether or not it does.

    The cost is named rather than hidden: two cases whose subjects differ ONLY in a masked
    identifier now share a source key and collapse to one review at the console. That is the
    right trade against publishing the identifier, and a subject distinguished solely by a
    national id is not a subject anyone should be keying on. The key stays stable across retries
    because ``pii_kit.redact`` substitutes a fixed token per pattern; checked, not assumed
